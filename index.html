        <h1>Fishery territories</h1>
        <p>There are 5 Tuna commissions, that fish in the designated open ocean territories listed below.
</p>
        <p> .<br>
            As for how to do this, aye theres the rub. I havent figured that out  yet.</p>

        <img src= "Fisheries_Map_08.png">
        <p>These fisheries often catch organisims that were not their intended target. These unintended targets are known as bycatch.<br>
        My data visualizations made this quarter cover various aspects about this bycatch in more detail.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Visualizations</h2>
        <p> 1: Graphic abstract assignment<br>
a basic run down of the implications of the data—that the estimated catch rate of by catch from these commissions does not match the data stated from these companies of their bycatch—with  only one of the affected species (Silky shark) illustrated and highlighted. I used interesting power point transitions to liven up the presentation. I also made the map at a later point.</p>
<br>
<p>2: animation
I Used a free, pre rigged 3d model of a shark from the site turbo squid (thank you to user Flytet) and the animation software Blender to animate a short to illustrate how creature such as sharks get caught as bycatch. Bycatch usually occurs for sharks and rays by hunting within the perimeter of a fishing net that has been widely cast, with a bottom that draws closed in order to trap the fish, resulting in the shark being dragged up with it.<br>(Note: the great white shark is NOT one of the affected species in our data, despite it being reflected in the animations model)</p>

<p>3: Publication ready illustration<br> 
I used the software R studio and ggplot to take CSV data of the number of affected species landed or discarded, and turn it into a graph. I also used ggplot to color code the species based on how endangered they were (using the IUCN scale for the  meaning of the colors).</p>
<br>
<p>4: Website<br>
            I used visual studio code, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Github to compose this website. </p>
